Rules
- Complete homework promptly after school, and in advance of deadlines
- Lights-out is at 8:45pm for ages 6 to 12; 9:30pm (11pm on Fri and Sat)for ages 13 to 14; and 10pm for ages 15-18. Once a week people can extend their lights out by 1 hour
- No personal devices in bedrooms at night. All devices must be in a designated area near the person's roo
(but outside it) at least 15 minutes before lights-out
- Maximum of 1 hour of non-school screen time on weekdays after school, only after homework and practice is done

Consequence Ladder (and Earning Back)
- **Most issues:** Reminder → Short pause (5–15 min) → Loss of related privilege (same day) → 24‑hr reduction + make amends.
- **Major issues (bullying, safety):** Immediate loss of device/social privileges 24–72h + repair plan.

Examples of making amends
- Write a sincere apology (3-5 sentences) and propose a fix
- Do a helpful task for the impacted person (e.g., clean their space, take their chore).
- Contribute time to a family project (organize closet, yard work).
- Don't bother the victim for a few hours

Family meetings
- Weekly, Sundays after dinner (15-30 min)
- Topics: review any updates to the rules, discuss issues with the rules and plans for the coming week
- Address assorted concerns/important things
