Rules
- Complete homework promptly after school, and in advance of deadlines

Consequence Ladder (and Earning Back)
- **Most issues:** Reminder → Short pause (5–15 min) → Loss of related privilege (same day) → 24‑hr reduction + make amends.
- **Major issues (bullying, safety):** Immediate loss of device/social privileges 24–72h + repair plan.

Examples of making amends
- Write a sincere apology (3-5 sentences) and propose a fix
-  Do a helpful task for the impacted person (e.g., clean their space, take their chore).
- Contribute time to a family project (organize closet, yard work).
- Don't bother the victim for a few hours

Family meetings
- Weekly, Sundays before dinner (15-30 min)
- Topics: review any updates to the rules, discuss issues with the rules and plans for the coming week
- Address assorted concerns/important things
